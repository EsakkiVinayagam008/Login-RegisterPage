<h1>Login & Register Page</h1>
<p>Welcome to our comprehensive user authentication system project, encompassing Login, Register, and Admin functionalities, powered by HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.

Our project offers a secure and user-friendly solution for managing user accounts and access privileges, catering to both regular users and administrators.

The Login and Register pages provide a seamless experience for users to create accounts and authenticate securely. With HTML and CSS, we've designed intuitive interfaces that guide users through the registration process and ensure a smooth login experience.

JavaScript enhances the user interaction, providing real-time validation and feedback to streamline the registration and login processes. From password strength indicators to form validation, our project leverages JavaScript to enhance security and usability.

On the server-side, PHP handles user authentication and database interactions. When users register, their credentials are securely stored in the MySQL database, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality. PHP scripts validate user credentials during login, granting access to authenticated users while maintaining robust security measures.

For administrators, our project includes Admin Login and Admin Register pages, allowing authorized personnel to manage user accounts and access privileges. Administrators can login securely using their credentials and perform essential tasks such as adding new users, resetting passwords, and modifying user roles.

With our comprehensive user authentication system, built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, we provide a reliable solution for managing user accounts and access control. Whether you're a regular user or an administrator, our project ensures a secure and seamless experience for all.</p>
